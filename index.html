        NodeSchool Madison is part of the global NodeSchool effort to voluntarily teach Node.js to anyone! The
        source code for the workshops is completely open source and the effort is entirely community driven.
        Best of all it is free.
      </p>
      <p>
        The NodeSchool meetings are working sessions, so bring a laptop. Mentors will be available to help
        if you are just getting started with Node.js, JavaScript, or programming.

          <div class="faq-question">What do I need to be prepared for the workshop?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              You will need to bring a laptop with you.  The majority of the time you will be writing JavaScript
              and running it through Node.js. Try to have Node.js installed on your machine before you attend the
              event. Fortunately Node.js is cross platform so you could write this code on a Windows, Mac, or
              Linux machine. Here are instructions on how to do that: <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">https://nodejs.org/en/download/</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              You should also install a text editor that supports syntax highlighting.  Most developers will have
              a personal preference, but if you are looking for a good one to start with try Atom (<a href="https://atom.io/">https://atom.io</a>).

          <div class="faq-question">What is the format of the events?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              Each event will begin with an introduction and an overview on the topics that will be covered
              for that session. All attendees will work on either one or 2 different ‘workshoppers’
              throughout the event.
            </p>

          <div class="faq-question">What is a workshopper?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              The defining characteristic of the workshopper is the interactivity and automation. Workshoppers
              are made up of challenges of increasing difficulty. Each challenge starts by explaining a concept,
              and then presents a list of requirements for solving the challenge. Learners then try and write
              a computer program that satisfies the criteria.
            </p>
            <p>
              When they feel confident about their solution they submit it to the workshop for verification. The
              workshop runs their solution and checks if all requirements were satisfied. If any are wrong or
              missing the learner gets contextual feedback and they can try again. If their code passes all of
              the criteria then they pass the challenge and move on to the next challenge.
            </p>
            <p>
              All of this happens in an automated way usually on the command line.

          <div class="faq-question">I don’t know JavaScript. Can I still attend?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              Of course! There are workshops specifically designed for people who are new to JavaScript. Also
              what better way to learn than through a self guided workshop with mentors available to answer
              your questions.
            </p>

        <li>
          <div class="faq-question">I am an expert in Node.js. Should I still attend?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              Workshops cover a great variety of topics. Assume that there are some available that would help
              you further your knowledge in a new topic. Even if you are an expert in all the things it doesn’t
              hurt to brush up or even better become a mentor.

          <div class="faq-question">How often will the events be held?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              Events will be held every other month. Since our first event is in December assume that the
              next will be February and then April, and then June and then… you get the idea.
