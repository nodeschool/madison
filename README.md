# NodeSchool Madison
NodeSchool Madison is part of the global NodeSchool effort to voluntarily teach Node.js to anyone! The source code for the workshops is completely open source and the effort is entirely community driven.

The NodeSchool meetings are working sessions, so bring a laptop. Mentors will be available to help if you are just getting started with Node.js, JavaScript, or programming.

More details to come.
